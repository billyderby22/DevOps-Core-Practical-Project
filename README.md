# DevOps-Core-Practical-Project
# #  Project brief - 
In this project we were tasked with creating an application consisting of four microservices that interact with each other to generate objects using some defined logic. The application needed to be produced and maintained using an automated CI/CD pipeline. The full tech stack can be seen below:

- Kanban board for project tracking
- Git for version control
- Jenkins as a CI server
- Ansible for configuration management
- GCP cloud platform
- Docker as a containerisation tool
- Docker swarm for container orchestration
- NGINX as a reverse proxy
